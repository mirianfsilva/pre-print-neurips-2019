# NeurIPS 2019 - Black in AI

I attended the 2019 NeurIPS Conference as Ambassador of Diversity and presented my undegraduate research, in a poster session at Black in AI Workshop co-located within the conference. Undergraduate research about Biological Sequence Analysis using a machine learning model called Profile Hidden Markov Models.

The NeurIPS brings together researchers from all fields engaged in fundamental work in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligent to enjoy a week of talks, panels, workshops, demonstrations and competitions.
